.. _whatsnew_060.api_breaking:

Backwards incompatible API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Deprecation of Yahoo readers.  Yahoo! retired the financial data end points in
  late 2017.  It is not possible to reliably retrieve data from Yahoo! without
  these endpoints. The Yahoo! readers have been immediately deprecated and
  will raise an `ImmediateDeprecationError` when called.

- Deprecation of EDGAR readers. EDGAR substantially altered their API. The EDGAR
  readers have been immediately deprecated and will raise an
  `ImmediateDeprecationError` when called.

- Google finance data will raise an `UnstableAPIWarning` when first called.
  Google has also altered their API in a way that makes reading data
  unreliable.  It many call it works.  However it also regularly fails,
  especially when used for bulk downloading. Google may be removed in the
  future.
